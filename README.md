# KeyCode Manager

KeyCode manager is a password-manager utility program. With the increased use of social media, and online services which require user authentication, KeyCode becomes an extremely important tool. It can encrypt your personal passwords, and keep them safe inside it.

## Features

* Created using Java and JavaFX (for GUI)
* Includes features like:
     * Program is password-protected to prevent eavesdropping and unauthorized access. (default username: nust, password: 1234)
     * Generating random password of any length and any combination (numeric, alphabetical, alphanumeric and alphanumeric+special characters)
     * Tells the strength of the generated password (takes only brute force attacks using an average computer into account)
     * Can encrypt any password using the encryption algorithm and store it
     * Can decrypt any password encrypted using KeyCode
     * Database storage ability (yet to be implemented)
